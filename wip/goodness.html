You must remember
that in the 
deepest time of need,
that there is 
goodness
in you.

You may not see it now,
but know 
that it is there,
behind overcast skies. (??)

It is 
there in the 
throes and the fits,
despair and elation,
willed or otherwise.

Beware though,
it does not 
license your acts, nor 
condone your crimes, nor
to allay concerns.

It is not of
these trivialities,
but much deeper.

It is there 
in the way
you face your hurt
despite the hurt.

It is there
in how you cry 
for it 
to be there
(for the simplest things)
beyond anything else.

It is there because
none of this dance
would be possible
if the core wasn&#8217;t good.
(if it wasn&#8217;t)

Also remember,
that it is there
in everyone else.
