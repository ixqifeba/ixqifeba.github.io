We must admit
the horrible ways
we employ
our faculties
in avoiding
what is
and ~~wait~~
in constant
apprehension
of what&amp;#8217;s to come.

We watch our lives
being spent,
channeled
into an automaticity
of prognostics,
of supreme architecture,
except for a rare glimpse
of cessation
here or there.

That the past should
predict the present
is preposterous.
And yet, it is
the foundation
of our inheritance.

To yield, cease,
drop the veil
and behold
in the glory of
what we can sense,
what we are and are not,
and
what can heal us.

To see without time,
is not seeing past, but
to be here,
in awe and
constant surprise.

And not on the lookout or defense
of that which once hurt you,
from where it&amp;#8217;ll strike again,
and all the plans you have for it.

In the now,
it is gone,
and perhaps you too
will have to shed
that history.

In due time,
I&amp;#8217;ll forget the significance
of what I&amp;#8217;ve been 
able to accomplish.
(nb: make passive)

Not the glory,
nor the story,
nor even that it was I.

That what I had once
resigned to
impossibility,
is from where
I record this.

That contentment
is a constant invitation.

The only responsibility
you have
is to listen and
allow yourself
to come forth.

I&amp;#8217;ve been here before.
Only a few
I can recall.

This time,
I see no reason
to resist
when it slowly 
pulls back
into the dark.

The dawn 
that arose
comforts
at dusk.

And that 
the dark
wasn&amp;#8217;t retribution
for some 
unknown, naive
transgression
that I failed 
to find
in my 
frenzied and frenetic
inquisitions.

That 
I am not 
even necessary
for this synchrony.

Nor with
any stake,
might as well
wade along.
