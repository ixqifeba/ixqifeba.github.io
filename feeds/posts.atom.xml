It is a myth
to think that
puberty only comes
once

in those awkward
early years
where we were
crudely hewn.

Even now,
I&amp;#8217;m constantly
called to
speak words
far larger
than myself.

My voice 
cracking, and my body
shaken,
rising from shambles
once again.

Reform into
something
I&amp;#8217;m yet so scared
to be.

Not knowing
even where I came from
before
I&amp;#8217;m asked to move out.

There is an
indelible
harshness here.

But,
I must admit as well,
begrudingly,
an inviting road
pinned to 
some distant horizon.

Language is 
the limit 
of description;
of our grasp.

Cognition is
the train
running in its
tracks.

They are one;
the frozen 
and 
the fluid.

Let these not
illude
and stand in for (belie)
what is.

There are few,
if any, poems
about the Pancreas,
despite importance,
because 
like language
we only see 
thrill and panic,
not the substrate.


Our reliance
on it for perception
is but a metaphor
for the grandeur
that awaits 
without it.

We must admit
the horrible ways
we employ
our faculties
in avoiding
what is
and cower
in constant
apprehension
of what&amp;#8217;s to come.

We watch our lives
being spent,
channeled
into an automaticity
of prognostics,
and stacking 
supreme architectures,
except for a rare glimpse
of cessation
here or there.

That the past should
predict the present
is a convincing error.
And yet, it is
the foundation
of our inheritance.

To yield, cease,
drop the veil
and behold
in the glory of
what we can sense,
what we are and are not,
and
what can heal us.

To see without time,
is not seeing past, but
to be here,
in awe and
constant surprise.

And not on the lookout or defense
of that which once hurt you,
from where it&amp;#8217;ll strike again,
and all the plans you have for it.

In the now,
it is gone,
and perhaps you too
will have to shed
that history.

Miles below
I&amp;#8217;ve left myself
of certainty,
and what&amp;#8217;s to come.

?something about the climb itself?

Exhaustion
grants ?a grace
? by making room for
by allowing nothing else.

In that exhaustion,
which grants grace,

In the exhaustion,
that grants grace
and room
for nothing else.

(Births a willing?)
There is a willing
to accept
whatever unfolds
xfor the gift
that it truly is,
in ever constant renew.

And allows, finally,
(as a consequence)
?allows the impetus behind the narratives to yield and continue its way
to unclutch
(?cleave)
 the force
that
drives stories



yielding memory ?itself
from the confines
of its (mortal) ?mental clutch.

?Let
Recoup its course
to (fade and) cease.
?and foldback into forgetting.

To feel that stream,
thoroughly rapt
and let unfurl
my boundaries
into it.

(Now?) Wondering
how that which
drove me here,
could have been
me at all.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!---

This is a dynamic of how we set off on journeys
not knowing where we go, but we know we can't go back.
We keep going forward and pushing ourselves
until we break and in that breaking we find a grace.

That which allows us to accept ourselves, our failures
our sincere fights we put for our poor hearts, knowing
that we may never win or even reach the end.
And yet we try.

We recognize this, our beauty, in that grace.
An in it, marvelous thing happens, we are absolved and 
released of the stories that dragged us there, or other
stories we so depend on to move us.

Because now we know that we are capable of moving despite
the story. That we are good deep enough that we dont need
them anymore.
And then we release and let them on their way, back into
the wind from which they came.

And in the glancing back, the thought must occur of the 
grander game being played here.
It doesn't matter our questions remain unanswered.

None of that matters, when you are witnesses the grandness
of the drama. 
Of how you were never alone, and yet not the center.
That you were always accounted for and cradled into your fruition.

It wasn&amp;#8217;t until 
I learned of gravity,
that I stopped taking
falling 
so personally.

The rules 
of the game
are such.

The best thought
is employed 
in finding 
what can be affected,
and
what must be accepted.

There&amp;#8217;s no hell
greater than 
having to hold
a personal grudge
against gravity.

Let the wind,
be the wind.

Let the wave,
be the wave.

Let the emotion,
be the emotion.

Let the mood,
be the mood.

Not a sign,
nor a totem,
or anything
but itself.

The world 
does not exist
simply to 
inform you.

How long
have I been deaf
to the invitation
of beauty.

Shimmering aspens,
gentle blue,
intimate whispers
of the breeze and 
the leaves.

I don&amp;#8217;t recall
ignoring you, 
but just that
you didn&amp;#8217;t sing anymore.

the resolve,
I held when the pain came,
I realize now
was not strength,
but desperation.

(to hear the chorus again)??

holy shit!
are you seeing this?
that&amp;#8217;s unbelievable!

no, not that. that.

what do you mean no?

why 
aren&amp;#8217;t you seeing 
what I&amp;#8217;m seeing?

it&amp;#8217;s
right
there!

No, not like that.
see it this way!
isn&amp;#8217;t that crazy?

what!?

why 
aren&amp;#8217;t you feeling 
what I&amp;#8217;m feeling?

You 
should be feeling
what I&amp;#8217;m feeling.

&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NO&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THAT&lt;/span&gt;!
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;LIKE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THIS&lt;/span&gt;!

&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;&amp;#8212;

Fuck you!
You piece of shit.

I was lost
in the abyss
so dark and so alone
without a horizon,
like an
untethered astronaut.

All I wanted 
was 
to be oriented
by you.
