Summary:

<div class="post-poem">

[
Those that reveal themselves
from the hidden
crevices of the canyons
]

Watch those echoes
that are far louder than
what set them off.

Those that revive
long forgotten ghosts

that slip
behind your eyes

They make themselves real
by employing your belief

They will convince you
that they are real

(use you to make themselves real)
