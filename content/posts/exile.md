Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
At the airport,
 my mother rushed
 after she got the tickets.

Past the visitor's glass
 where my grandma, and grandpa
 waited to say good bye.

She stormed past,
 not knowing how to face them,
 she asked me to go back.

I was too scared,
 and confused
 to have to choose between the two.

I didn't go back.

30 years since,
 I realize now,
 what I didn't know I left behind.

The land, scent, the informalities;
 the comfort of all the things
 that held me in place

 like a jacket, form fit and
 touching all the right edges;
 A second skin of belonging.
