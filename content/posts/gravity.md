Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
It wasn't until  
I learned of gravity,
that I stopped taking
falling 
so personally.

The rules 
of the game
are such.

The best thought
is employed 
in finding 
what can be affected,
and
what must be accepted.

There's no hell
greater than 
having to hold
a personal grudge
against gravity.
