Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
It is not 
what is seen,
or being seen.

It is
in the looking.

The shape
of the cast net,
The basis
of your vector space.

It is the 
contours of perception
being revealed.

How it bends here,
tucks there,
omits this,
indulges that.

It is not what is brought,
but what illuviates.
