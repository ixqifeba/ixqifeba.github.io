Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
It is a myth
to think that
puberty only comes
once

in those awkward
early years
where we were
crudely hewn.

Even now,
I'm constantly
called to
speak words
far larger
than myself.

My voice 
cracking, and my body
shaken,
rising from shambles
once again.

Reform into
something
I'm yet so scared
to be.

Not knowing
even where I came from
before
I'm asked to move out.

There is an
indelible
harshness here.

But,
I must admit as well,
begrudingly,
an inviting road
pinned to 
some distant horizon.
