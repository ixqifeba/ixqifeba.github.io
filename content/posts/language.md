Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
Language is 
the limit 
of description;
of our grasp.

Cognition is
the train
running in its
tracks.

They are one;
the prior frozen 
and 
the latter fluid.

Let these not
illude
and stand in for (belie)
what is.



Our reliance
on it for perception
is but a metaphor
for the grandeur
that awaits 
without it.
