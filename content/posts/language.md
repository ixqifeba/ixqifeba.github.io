Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
Language is 
the limit 
of description;
of our grasp.

Cognition is
the train
running in its
tracks.

They are one;
the frozen 
and 
the fluid.

Let these not
illude
and stand in for (belie)
what is.

There are few,
if any, poems
about the Pancreas,
despite importance,
because 
like language
we only see 
thrill and panic,
not the substrate.


Our reliance
on it for perception
is but a metaphor
for the grandeur
that awaits 
without it.
