Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
How long
have I been deaf
to
the invitation
of beauty.
shimmering aspens,
gentle blue,
intimate whispers
between the breeze and the leaves,

I don't recall
ignoring you, 
but just that
you didn't sing anymore.

the resolve,
I held when pain came,
I realize now
was not strength,
but desperation.

(to hear the chorus again)??
