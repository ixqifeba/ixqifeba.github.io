<div class="post-poem">
How long
have I been deaf
to the invitation
of beauty.

Shimmering aspens,
gentle blue,
intimate whispers
of the breeze and 
the leaves.

I don't recall
ignoring you, 
but just that
you didn't sing anymore.

the resolve,
I held when the pain came,
I realize now
was not strength,
but desperation.

(to hear the chorus again)??
