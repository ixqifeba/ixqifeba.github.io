Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
Without a warning
we sailed
into a storm.

Tossed and turned,
time slowed down.

We set down the sails,
boarded and hatched
every door and cellar.

Waiting for it to pass.

How were we to know
when it did?
For no sea
is without waves.

So, we sat waiting.

Waiting for storms,
so our fears
could be sated.
