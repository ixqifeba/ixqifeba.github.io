Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
In due time,
I'll forget the significance
of what I've been 
able to accomplish.
(nb: make passive)

Not the glory,
nor the story,
nor even that it was I.

That what I had once
resigned to
impossibility,
is from where
I record this.

That contentment
is a constant invitation.

The only responsibility
you have
is to listen and
allow yourself
to come forth.

I've been here before.
Only a few
I can recall.

This time,
I see no reason
to resist
when it slowly 
pulls back
into the dark.

The dawn 
that arose
comforts
at dusk.

And that 
the dark
wasn't retribution
for some 
unknown, naive
transgression
that I failed 
to find
in my 
frenzied and frenetic
inquisitions.

That 
I am not 
even necessary
for this synchrony.

Nor with
any stake,
might as well
wade along.
