Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
(So complete that I fell asleep)

Punching wildly
across the veil, and
against the shadows
from a
forgotten slumber.


--

To look, and let be.

Forestalling
a growth,
even when 
it undoes 
no pain,
as I hoped,
but
forestalls
the encounter with
the unfurling
of a beautiful song.
nb: song is not fitting the unfurling 

The great crime 
<s>committed</s>
is to not let be,
be what is.
