Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
I looked deep
into a flower.
And,
I became 
that flower.

nb: add another metaphor?

I looked deep 
into my thoughts.
And, I 
became
those thoughts.

(So complete that I fell asleep)

Punching wildly
across the veil, and
against the shadows
from that 
forgotten slumber.

Forestalling
a growth,
even when 
it undoes 
no pain,
as I hoped,
but
forestalls
the encounter with
the unfurling
of a beautiful song.
nb: song is not fitting the unfurling 

The great crime 
<s>committed</s>
is to not let be,
be what is.

<s>is to not let me be,
be what I am.</s>

To look, and let be.
