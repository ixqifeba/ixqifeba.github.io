Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
It is a myth
to think that
puberty only comes
once

and in those (that) awkward
early years
where we're
entirely (malformed, mis-shapen) unformed.

I'm constantly
called to
speak words
far larger
than myself.

My voice 
breaking, and my body
trembling
yet again.

(reminding me of the lack of control of puberty)

And become
something
I'm yet so scared
to be.

Not knowing
even where I came from
before
I'm asked to move out.

There is an
inexorable/indelible? meanness here,
but also
(an adventure.)

an invitation
to some
ineffable adventure
