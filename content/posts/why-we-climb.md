Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
Miles below
I've left myself
of certainty,
and what's to come.

?something about the climb itself?

Exhaustion
grants ?a grace
? by making room for
by allowing nothing else.

In that exhaustion,
which grants grace,

In the exhaustion,
that grants grace
and room
for nothing else.

(Births a willing?)
There is a willing
to accept
whatever unfolds
xfor the gift
that it truly is,
in ever constant renew.

And allows, finally,
(as a consequence)
?allows the impetus behind the narratives to yield and continue its way
to unclutch
(?cleave)
 the force
that
drives stories



yielding memory ?itself
from the confines
of its (mortal) ?mental clutch.

?Let
Recoup its course
to (fade and) cease.
?and foldback into forgetting.

To feel that stream,
thoroughly rapt
and let unfurl
my boundaries
into it.

(Now?) Wondering
how that which
drove me here,
could have been
me at all.

This is a dynamic of how we set off on journeys
not knowing where we go, but we know we can't go back.
We keep going forward and pushing ourselves
until we break and in that breaking we find a grace.

That which allows us to accept ourselves, our failures
our sincere fights we put for our poor hearts, knowing
that we may never win or even reach the end.
And yet we try.

We recognize this, our beauty, in that grace.
An in it, marvelous thing happens, we are absolved and 
released of the stories that dragged us there, or other
stories we so depend on to move us.

Because now we know that we are capable of moving despite
the story. That we are good deep enough that we dont need
them anymore.
And then we release and let them on their way, back into
the wind from which they came.

And in the glancing back, the thought must occur of the 
grander game being played here.
It doesn't matter our questions remain unanswered.

None of that matters, when you are witnesses the grandness
of the drama. 
Of how you were never alone, and yet not the center.
That you were always accounted for and cradled into your fruition.
