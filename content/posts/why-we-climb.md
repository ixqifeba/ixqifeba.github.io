Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
Though conquer appeals,
hidden affiliates 
emerge
 
`---`

Miles below
where I've left myself
of certainty
and what's to come.

The exhaustion
that grants grace
by allowing nothing else.

Willing to accept
whatever may come,
(whatever unfolds)
for the gift that it is,
in constant renew.

Yielding memory
from the confines
of its (mortal) clutch. 
Recoup its course 
to (fade and) cease.

To feel that stream,
thoroughly rapt
and let unfurl
my boundaries 
into it.

Wondering 
how that which 
drove me here,
could have been
me at all.
