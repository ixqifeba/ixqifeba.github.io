Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
Miles below
I've left myself
of certainty
and what's to come.

?something about the climb itself?

The exhaustion
grants ?a grace
? by making room for 
by allowing nothing else.

?Then
Willing to accept
whatever unfolds
for the gift that it is,
in constant renew.

?Finally
Yielding memory ?itself
from the confines
of its (mortal) ?mental clutch. 

?Let
Recoup its course 
to (fade and) cease.
?back into forgetting.

To feel that stream,
thoroughly rapt
and let unfurl
my boundaries 
into it.

Wondering 
how that which 
drove me here,
could have been
me at all.
