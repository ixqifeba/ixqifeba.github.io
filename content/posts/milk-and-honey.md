Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">

Such paltry creatures
that would paint
their heaven
with words
of simple nourishment;
milk and honey.

The simple things
that have little gain
but the soothing
of their soft animal
to a calm.

To be born
into such a desert,
having to fight for breath,
and yet 
wanting a heaven 
of simple nourishment.

How lovely a creature!
