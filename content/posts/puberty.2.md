Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
It is a myth
to think that
puberty only comes
once

in those awkward
early years
where we were
// entirely (malformed, mis-shapen, oblong?) unformed.
crudely hewn

(even now)
I'm constantly
called to
speak words
far larger
than myself.

My voice 
cracking, and my body
flesh in trills
trembling
shaken

(to rise from defeat)
(rising from the shambles)
yet again.

(reminding me of the lack of control of puberty)

And become
(reform into)
something
I'm yet so scared
to be.

Not knowing
even where I came from
before
I'm asked to move out.

There is an
inexorable/indelible? meanness here,
but also
(an adventure.)

an invitation
to some
ineffable adventure

an inviting road
pinned to horizon
