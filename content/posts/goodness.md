Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
You must remember
that in the 
deepest time of need,
that there is 
goodness
in you.

It is there 
in the throes and fits,
the heights and the lows.

You may not see it now,
but know it is there.

It may be masked,
like an overcast sky.

It is not of blind belief,


It is there because
none of this dance
would be possible
if the core wasn't good.

It does not license
your acts, or 
condone your crimes.

It cares not of
these trivialities.

The worst crimes
were seeded by the
want of better.

It is not 
to be taken
to condone your acts
or justify a grudge. (??)

It is there in the way
you face your hurt
despite the hurt.

It is there
in how you cry
for it to be there
(for the simplest things)
beyond anything else.
