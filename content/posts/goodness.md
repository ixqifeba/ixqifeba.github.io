Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
You must remember
that in the 
deepest time of need,
that there is 
goodness
in you.

It is there 
in the throes and the fits,
despair and elation,
willed or otherwise.

You may not see it now,
but know 
that it is there,
behind overcast skies.

Beware though,
it does not 
license your acts, nor 
condone your crimes.

Nor an totem
to allay concerns.

It is not of
these trivialities,
but much deeper.

The worst crimes
were seeded by the
want of better.

It is there in the way
you face your hurt
despite the hurt.

It is there
in how you cry
for it to be there
(for the simplest things)
beyond anything else.

It is not of blind belief,
or complicity.

It is there because
none of this dance
would be possible
if the core wasn't good.
