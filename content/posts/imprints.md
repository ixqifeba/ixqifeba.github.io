Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
I was told of you.
The danger you conceal,
even the kindness 
is suspect.

You are an other,
unlike my kind,
to be watched,
with narrowed eyes.

I have been away too long,
far from home,
cracked skin and haggard,
having lost 
my own reflection.

...

I must've been crying
and scared
when I saw
my grandmother in your concern,
my aunt in your smile,
my uncle in your *protection 
my brother in your *sharing. (companionship) embrace


in their embrace,
I lost the boundary??
---
In your stoic persistence,
that I turned 
for an embrace,
I realized then
that's how they died
and all
they had done for me.
--/

I didn't know
that's how they died
and what
they had done for me.

Cast me off,
cotyledon and all,
---
booster rockets and supplies
sails and supplies,
a ruderal
to forge itself
and 
to bloom beauty
anywhere
--/
to forge? roots
and
to bloom
anywhere.

(Space metaphor?)
