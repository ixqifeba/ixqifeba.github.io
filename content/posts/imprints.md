Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
I was told of you.
The danger you conceal,
even the kindness
is suspect.

You are an other,
unlike my kind,
to be watched,
with narrowed eyes.

I have been away too long,
far from home,
cracked skin and haggard,
having lost
my own reflection.

...

It wasn't until I saw
my grandmother in your concern,
my aunt in your smile,
my brother in your camaraderie, and
my sister in your sweetness.

in their embrace,
I lost the boundary??
the divide.

---
In your stoic persistence,
that I turned
for an embrace,
I realized then
that's how they died
and all
they had done for me.
--/

I didn't know
that's how they died
and what
they had done for me.

In forming the clay
and planting
the seeds,
that would
spring to life.

Cast me off,
cotyledon and all,
---
booster rockets strapped,
sails and supplies;
a ruderal
to forge itself
and
to bloom beauty
anywhere.

to forge? roots
and
to bloom
anywhere.
