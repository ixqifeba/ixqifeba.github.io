Summary:

<div class="post-poem">

I had been away too long,
far from home,
cracked skin and haggard,
having lost
my own reflection.

It wasn't until I saw
my grandmother in your concern,
my aunt in your smile,
my brother in your camaraderie, and
my sister in your sweetness.

In that embrace,
I lost 
the divide.

I didn't know
that's how they died
and what
they had done for me.

In forming the clay
and planting
the seeds,
that would
spring to life.

Cast me off,
booster rockets strapped,
sails and supplies,
cotyledon and all;
a ruderal,
to forge its roots
and
to bloom 
anywhere.
