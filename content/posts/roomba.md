Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
Like a Roomba
cornered, 
and
bashing itself 
into the wall.

No need for 
wrecking balls, or
new designs.

The failure
in persistence,
is no failure.

Just a message
to reorient, and
to break the yet
undiscovered
symmetry.

Pray that I'm
a bit smarter,
when my head aches.
