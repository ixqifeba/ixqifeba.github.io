Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
holy shit!
are you seeing this?
that's unbelievable!

no, not that. that.

what do you mean no?

why 
aren't you seeing 
what I'm seeing?

it's
right
there!

No, not like that.
see it this way!

isn't that crazy?

what!?

why 
aren't you feeling 
what I'm feeling?

You 
should be feeling
what I'm feeling.

NO, NOT LIKE THAT!
LIKE THIS!

----------------

Fuck you!
You piece of shit.

I was lost
in the abyss
so dark and alone,
like an
untethered astronaut.

All I wanted
was to be oriented
by you.
