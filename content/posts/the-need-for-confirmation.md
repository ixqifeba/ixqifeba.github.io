Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
holy shit!
are you seeing this?
that's unbelievable!

no, not that. that.

what do you mean no?
why aren't you 
seeing what i'm saying?

it's right there.

no, not like that.
see it this way.

isn't that crazy?

why aren't you 
feeling what I feel?

You should be feeling
what I feel.

No, not like that.
Like this.

...

Fuck you!
You piece of shit.

I was lost
in a black abyss,
like a 
untethered astronaut.

All I wanted
was to be oriented
by you.
