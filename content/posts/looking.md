Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
I looked deep
into a flower.
And,
I became 
that flower.

I looked deep 
into my thoughts.
And, I 
became
those thoughts.

Punching wildly
from a 
forgotten slumber.

The greatest crime 
I've committed
is to not let be,
be what is.

<s>is to not let me be,
be what I am.</s>

To look.

<s>To forestall</s>
Forestalling
growth,
to fit in.
Even when 
it undoes
no pain, and
simply hinders
the unfurling
of a beautiful song.
