Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
I looked deep
into a flower.
And,
I became 
that flower.

I looked deep 
into my thoughts.
And, I 
became
those thoughts.

The greatest crime 
I've committed
is to not let me be,
be what I am.

To look,
and let be.

To forestall
a growth,
<s>that I'd fit in.</s>
to fit in.

The developments

so crucial,
that it undoes
no pain,
just hinders
the unfurling
of a beautiful song.
