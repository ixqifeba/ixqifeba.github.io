Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
I looked deep
into a flower.
And,
I became 
that flower.

nb: add another metaphor?

I looked deep 
into my thoughts.
And, I 
became
those thoughts.

Punching wildly
from a 
forgotten slumber.

Forestalling
a growth,
<s>to fit in.</s>
Even when 
it undoes 
no pain, 
but
simply hinders

delays
the encounter

the unfurling
of a beautiful song.
nb: song is not fitting the unfurling 

The greatest crime 
I've committed
is to not let be,
be what is.

<s>is to not let me be,
be what I am.</s>

To look, and let be.
</div>
