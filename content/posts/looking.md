Summary:

<div class="post-poem">
I looked deep
into a flower.
And I became
a flower.

I looked deep 
into my thoughts.
And I became
those thoughts.

The great crime 
is to not let me
be
be what I am.

To embog
growth,
even 
when it undoes
no pain,
but simply forestalls
the unfurling
of a beautiful song.
nb: forestalls sounds clunky
nb: song is not fitting here.
