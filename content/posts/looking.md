Summary:


<div class="post-poem">
I looked deep
into a flower.
And I became
a flower.

I looked deep 
into my thoughts.
And I became
those thoughts.

The greatest crime 
I've done
is to not let me
be
be what I am.

To forestall
growth,
that I'd fit in.

The developments
so crucial,
that it undoes
no pain,
but the hindrances
of a beautiful song.
