Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
We must admit
the horrible ways
we employ
our faculties
in avoiding
what is
and cower
in constant
apprehension
of what's to come.  

We watch our lives
being spent,
channeled
into an automaticity
of prognostics,
and stacking 
supreme architectures,
except for a rare glimpse
of cessation
here or there.

That the past should
predict the present
is a convincing error.
And yet, it is
the foundation
of our inheritance.

To yield, cease,
drop the veil
and behold
in the glory of
what we can sense,
what we are and are not,
and
what can heal us.

To see without time,
is not seeing past, but
to be here,
in awe and
constant surprise.

And not on the lookout or defense
of that which once hurt you,
from where it'll strike again,
and all the plans you have for it.

In the now,
it is gone,
and perhaps you too
will have to shed
that history.
