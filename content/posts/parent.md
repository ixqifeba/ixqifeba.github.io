Summary: 

<div class="post-poem">
The goal of a parent
is to create
the space of love
for the arrival.

To anchor/apprentice
a new born love.

To foster it,
let it blossom.

To then connect it
back into themselves
and the rest of the world
at once.

To apprentice them
in how they belong
and how they ascertain
what they need.

To connect that
with the
flow of existence.
