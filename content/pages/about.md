* _wasureraru (忘れられる)_ meaning:
    * I do not know Japanese. I just really liked the package of the word.

        1. discard something previously learned
        2. unlearn

* Why write:   
    1. I don't completely know
    2. To snapshot what I forgot I was like.
    3. To help <s>myself</s> whatever fish finds itself in this stream.
    4. These are not mine, just recorded by me.
